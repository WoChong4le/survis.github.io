        "abstract": "Open world games present players with more freedom than games with linear progression structures. However, without clearly-defined objectives, they often leave players without a sense of purpose. Most of the time, quests and objectives are hand-authored and overlaid atop an open world's mechanics. But what if they could be generated organically from the gameplay itself? The goal of our project was to develop a model of the mechanics in Minecraft that could be used to determine the ideal placement of objectives in an open world setting. We formalized the game logic of Minecraft in terms of logical rules that can be manipulated in two ways: they may be executed to generate graphs representative of the player experience when playing an open world game with little developer direction; and they may be statically analyzed to determine dependency orderings, feedback loops, and bottlenecks. These analyses may then be used to place achievements on gameplay actions algorithmically.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, we examine the need for usability methods for game design and argue that within the level design discipline in game design there is a distinct lack of usability methods for users with low game literacy. Therefore, we propose that there is a need for guidance methods to properly accommodate players of all levels of game literacy in the game world. With the player having to spend the majority of its time in digital game environments and color being a basic component of any environment, we have decided to use color contrasts to determine whether color is suitable for player guidance. The goal of this paper is to determine whether player behavior, both in decision making and in viewing behavior, can be influenced through color contrasts.",

        "abstract": "Video game design requires a user-centered approach to ensure that the experience enjoyed by players is as good as possible. However, the nature of player\u2013video game interactions has not as yet been clearly defined in the scientific literature. The purpose of the present study was to provide a systematic review of empirical evidences of the current concepts of player\u2013video game interactions in entertainment situations. A total of 72 articles published in scientific journals that deal with human\u2013computer interaction met the criteria for inclusion in the present review. Major findings of these articles were presented in a narrative synthesis. Results showed that player\u2013video game interactions could be defined with multiple concepts that are closely linked and intertwined. These concepts concern player aspects of player\u2013video game interactions, namely engagement and enjoyment, and video game aspects, namely information input/output techniques, game contents and multiplayer games. Global approaches, such as playability, also exist to qualify player\u2013video game interactions. Limitations of these findings are discussed to help researchers to plan future advances of the field and provide supplementary effort to better know the role of less-studied aspects. Practical implications are also discussed to help game designers to optimize the design of player\u2013video game interactions.",

        "abstract": "This article investigates the impact that the rhythms of game interactions can have on a player\u2019s experience of a computer game. Using a phenomenological approach, the research focuses on rhythmic experience within games and, in particular, on the rhythm of tree chopping within the games Minecraft and Don\u2019t Starve. Graphic, aural, and embodied representations are used to closely analyze and compare a single-player experience within the two games. The analysis reflects on the efficacy of these methods and suggests some possible key factors for designing rhythmically expressive play experiences. It is suggested that combining real-time control with perceivable and performable repetition and variety can give the player expressive creative control over the rhythms of their performed interactions, potentially enriching their experience of repetitive tasks and extending the play life of a game.",

        "abstract": "By moving away from a model of ritual that focuses on magic and fantasy worlds, this article seeks to broaden the discussion of ritual actions, performances, and objects in first- and third-person video games. Ritual will be understood through the idea of a \u201critual logic\u201d that enables the wider associations of ritual in the virtual as opposed to the real world to be analyzed, and through the key element of repetition in game play. In part derived from the intertextuality of video game genres and associated popular culture artifacts such as films and novels, ritual logic contributes to the players\u2019 knowledge and understanding of what ritual is and what ritual does in the game, and how ritual can be used to progress its narrative and play trajectories.",

        "abstract": "The computer gaming industry has today become bigger than the world music and movie industries. The influence of computer games over the youth of today is akin to that of the cultural influence of music, political movements and even religion on youth culture of the past. Of late, computer games have been attracting people of all kinds into using computers. They have driven the spread of computers into the lives of individuals who had earlier had no incentive to use them. Computer games are gaining unprecedented access to the homes, minds and souls of people today. Hence it has become increasingly important for game developers and educators to study the application of computers for enhancing the education offered to the next generation of students. Computer games can be used to give a better form of education and can even make computers become the unique tools of learning. The paper will present the current scenarios of computer games being used for the purposes of education and training. It will also dwell on areas in which the tremendous capabilities of computer games as an education medium can be utilized in educating a new generation of students weaned on computer games. New possibilities for computer games as tools of knowledge will also be projected.",

        "abstract": "Storyline is one of the major motivators that lead people to play video games. However, little empirical evidence exists on the instructional effectiveness of integrating a storyline into digital learning materials. This systematic literature review presents current empirical findings on the effects of a storyline game design element for human learning and performance that were analyzed using a multidimensional approach for classifying storyline outcomes and impacts. Specifically, it addresses two key questions: (a) What types of storyline were empirically examined? and (b) What are the unique affordances of digital storyline-enhanced learning? Only eleven studies that assessed the relative effectiveness of digital story-based interventions as compared to a non-story-based method were found. These findings present mixed results for storyline-related instructional effectiveness and suggest directions for future investigations and also practical guidance for designing effective story-based digital learning environments.",

        "abstract": "What  are  nonverbal  guidance  systems  in  open-world  games?  Why  are  they  so  important for the immersive aspect in a game and how do game developers de-sign such systems with a high usability? In order to answer these questions, non-verbal  guidance  systems  were  analyzed  according  to  their  perceptual  channels,  using  an  approach  based  on  the  semiotic  symbol  theory.  This  research  process,  which started in the context of a Master Thesis in the subject area in Game De-sign at the Zurich University of the Arts, resulted in six different guidance sys-tems.  As  a  way  of  showing  the  applicability  of  these  systems  to  open-world  games, nine different open-world games were successfully categorized according to  the  identified  guidance  systems.  Furthermore,  a  survey  was  conducted  with  the  aim  of  examining  the  players\u2019  and  game  developers\u2019  views  about  guidance  systems in open-world games. This article presents a catalogue of different guidance systems and their use in  open-world  games.  It  provides  the  means  to  a  deep  understanding  of  what  is  necessary  for  good  player-leading,  and  explains  how  to  improve  existing  guid-ance systems.",

        "abstract": "Currently, a full appreciation of how problem gaming impacts the daily lives of gamers is lacking. This study aims to gain a more holistic understanding of the activities in the daily lives of problem gamers; particularly, what is important to them, what motivates gaming, and what supports/constraints engagement in other life activities. Semi-structured interviews and week-long activity logs were used to collect data from the 16 problem gamers in five countries. Qualitative data were analyzed thematically. Two main themes emerged. First, gaming was found to be a meaningful and purposeful activity. Participants in this study understood what activities offered them a sense of meaning and personal growth. Video gaming offered both positive and negative experiences in gamers\u2019 lives. The negative experiences mainly resulted from using video games as a coping strategy for other life stressors. Second, individual, interpersonal, and environmental influences acted simultaneously to push and pull on the amount of gaming. The push and pull influences on the amount of gaming can occur in real-life or virtually. Assistance for problem gamers could include minimizing/removing the pull forces and obtaining adequate push forces to enable their desired participation in daily activities.",
